# K-ban (kanban clone)
Kanban is a neat tool for productivity. Making my own version can make me better understand the design choices made.

### v1.0 Features Checklist:
- [x] boards are responsive
- [x] create boards or kanban that contain tasks
- [x] inside these boards tasks can be made and can be limited by number

- [ ] tasks can also contain subtasks 
  - [ ] which can be checked as complete with a gui update
- [ ] all tasks, boards, and subtasks are editable
- [ ] all of these also have size constraints that are expandable or displayable somehow
---------------------------------------------
### Future Improvements/ Features:

- drag and drop between boards
- color picker for boards, tasks, everything
- icons for team members
  - default icons to choose from
- add auth
- light media integration options
  - jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, etc.
- links and notes to be added for tasks
